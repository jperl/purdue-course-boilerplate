            <h4>About the Course</h4>

            <p>Success in a tech startup has two ingredients: a product which adds significant value + traction.
                This class will help get you from an idea to a product so you can start to get traction. You will
                get strategy advice on your ideas, utilize the latest web and mobile technologies, and be matched up
                with other talented individuals to build a product. You will retain all rights to software you
                created in this class (it will not be owned by Purdue). This will be a three credit hour pass/fail course
                sponsored by Tim Korb.

                <h4>When is the class? What is the CRN?</h4>

                <p>The class starts Fall 2013 and will be from 6:30 pm - 8:30 pm on Thursdays. The number is CS49000-WMS
                    and the CRN is 64595.

            <div class="faq">
                <h4>Do I have to be an CS student at Purdue?</h4>

                <p>No but you must be able to contribute to building the application, see <a href="#prerequisites">prerequisites</a>.
                </p>

                <p>I will be accepting the top 12 undergraduate students along with any exceptional graduate,
                    faculty, or community members and merge them into teams.

            <div class="faq">
                <h4>What are the prerequisites?</h4>

                <p>You must be able to demonstrate that you have enough HTML5 and Javascript experience to make it
                    through the <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web" target="_blank">web fundamentals</a>,
                    <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/jquery" target="_blank">jquery</a>, and <a
                            href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript" target="_blank">javascript</a>
                    codecademy tracks.
                </p>

                <p>Top candidates will have projects that show their ability to learn technologies outside of the
                    classroom.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="idea" class="support-spacer"></div>
            <div class="faq">
                <h4>Do I need an idea to apply?</h4>

                <p>No, it is unlikely you will even be working on the idea you apply with. Ideas will have little impact
                    on who gets into the class, technical ability is the most important factor.

            <div class="faq">
                <h4>How can I get started now?</h4>

                <p>You are the kind of person we are looking for. I have already started to connect students so they
                    can start building things, so don't wait to apply.
                </p>

                <p>Also feel free to touch up on your <a href="#prerequisites">technical skills</a> and get started with
                    <a href="http://www.meteor.com" target="_blank">meteor</a>.</p>

            <div class="faq">
                <h4>When is the application due?</h4>

                <p>The application will close sometime in the summer (July?) and you can update it anytime until then.
                    Don't wait to apply because <a href="#start-now">teams are already forming</a>.</p>

            <div id="time" class="support-spacer"></div>
            <div class="faq">
                <h4>How much time will I spend each week?</h4>

                <p>Passionate people spend all of their free time on their projects. I am looking for passionate people.

            <div class="faq">
                <h4>Do I receive credit?</h4>

                <p>If you are an undergraduate student the class counts as a 3 credit hour CS elective.
                    However that should not be your incentive because the out of class commitment is going to be
                    extreme.
